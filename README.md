# Godot-.NET
My implementations of Godot's getting started projects, translated from GDScript to C# .NET and rewritten for efficient variable reuse. 

## The gist
I noticed most of Godot's tutorials are for GDScript because it is approachable for beginners to write code quickly; however, as projects scale I believe C# with IDE integration (e.g. Visual Studio) could make development time faster due to the enhanced debugging and refactoring capabilities. I implemented Godot's getting started tutorials in C# to provide samples of its use in Godot, rewriting them for variable reuse by declaring variables as class properties.

This is a work in progress. The C# files will be added once completed.
